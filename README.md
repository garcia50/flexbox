# Intro To Flexbox

## Let's Review

### The CSS Box Model

- Every html tag is surrounded by a box. The box consists of the content, padding, border and margin. Let's discuss each property individually.

### Block vs. Inline Display

- Certain tags have default display values. For example, an `h1` tag is a block-level tag and `img` is an inline tag. We can alter this by changing the CSS.

### Bootstrap vs Flexbox

- We can use the grid system (Bootstrap), which works fine but requires more digging into docs and base knowledge about how it works.
- Flexbox allows us to manipulate the position of tags without all the knowledge of a larger grid system.
